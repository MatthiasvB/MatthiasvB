- 👋 Hi, I’m @MatthiasvB
- 👀 I’m interested in how the world works, why it does it this way, how to affect it at scale, and how to detach myself from it. That's why I studied Material's Science, read books like "Sapiens", learned programming, and work towards location independence.
- 🌱 I’m currently working in Web Development, particularly using the MEAN stack for highly reactive apps.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will make our lifes easier, educate the masses, or save the planet.
- 📫 How to reach me: matthias.vombruch-at-gmx-dot-de
